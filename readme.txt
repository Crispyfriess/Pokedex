Hello, Sir(s)! or maybe Reagan or Laurent!

This is Raditya speaking, or rather... typing!
If there are things that you want to clarify/need help from, you can always just text me. I'm always (most of the time), online anyways. 

Alternatively, if you're too lazy to download things and run it from your computer. You can just fork the repository from this link!
